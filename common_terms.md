**Artificial Intelligence** - a field of computer science that strives to achieve intelligence within machines.    
**Machine Learning** - a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. In simpler words "learning" done by a Machine Learning algorithm means learning the patterns present in data.    
**Deep Learning** - a subset of Machine Learning where the algorithms are capable of doing a more comprehensive form of "learning".   
**Computer Vision** - deals with how computers can be made for gaining high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Deep Learning algorithms are mostly used to automate tasks usually performed by the human visual system.    
**Natural Language processing** - deals with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to fruitfully process large amounts of natural language data. Machine Learning and Deep Learning are used to process the natural language data.     
**Data Science** - interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured. The insights can be gathered via Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
